## Scraping

Steps involved in Scraping thehimilayantimes.

1. I collected 10 catagories.
2. For each catagories I scraped links from 10 pages of content, each page had around 20 articles, and stored the link in meta_data.csv file.
3. Then I scraped content text for the 2000 links collected.
4. I also made sure to keep their catagories, title, Published date and time. This may come in handy for some other tasks.
