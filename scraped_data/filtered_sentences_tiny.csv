"Four months after a murder, Rautahat police finally detained the person behind the crime"
"Everyone thought he would be tried for murder, but surprisingly, police ended up initiating a case against him for indecent behaviour, much to the dismay of locals waiting for justice"
Seventyyearold Shekh Taiyab of Rautahats Dewahi Gonahi Municipality was murdered on the night of May 25
Police arrested a local of Dewahi Gonahi Municipality and an Indian national in connection with the murder
"But instead of pressing a murder case against them, police filed an indecent behaviour case against the duo"
This has made the locals sceptical about the police motive
"The arrested duo, Shekh Saraj of Dewahi Gonahi and Rakesh Kushwaha of India, are being investigated for indecent behaviour"
"The main suspects in the murder, Dewahi Gonahis former ward chairperson Shekh Nurullah, and Shekh Saddham, among others, are still at large"
Nurullah was also the mastermind behind the murder of the priest of Hanuman temple in Madhav Narayan Municipality
"In connection with the priests murder, Nurullah remained at large for long before he secretly presenting himself at the court and then mysteriously secured his release by posting a bail of Rs 200,000"

"As the duos involvement in the murder has been revealed, we are preparing to sue them for murder, said SP Bir Bahadur Budha Magar of District Police Office Rautahat"
Three UN special rapporteurs and a Working Group have pointed out problems in the latest Truth and Reconciliation Act Amendment bill and requested Nepal government to furnish a reply
"According to a copy of the document the special rapporteurs sent to the government, which Advocacy Group provided to this daily, the special rapporteurs wrote that the bill was inconsistent with Nepals obligation to investigate human rights violations committed during the 19962006 internal armed conflict"
"The special rapporteurs wrote The bill introduces a twopronged categorisation of violations of human rights to be considered by the transitional justice mechanisms, which appears to be inconsistent with the classification of such violations under international standards"
"According to Section 2 4 of the bill, human rights violations comprise the following crimes murder sexual violence, physical or psychosocial torture, abduction or hostage taking, unlawful detention, assault, dismembering or making disabled, looting, seizing, vandalising, arson of private or public property, forceful eviction or displacement, and other inhumane acts against human rights and humanitarian law committed against unarmed civilians or communities in a widespread and targeted manner, the special rapporteurs wrote in their letter"
"They said Section 2 5 of the bill listed murder with cruelty or torture or inhuman conduct, rape, enforced disappearance, and inhuman or cruel torture committed against unarmed civilians or communities in a widespread and targeted manner as serious human rights violations, but this list does not encompass all serious human rights violations defined in international law"
"They further wrote According to the bill, crimes that fall under the category of human rights violations can be the subject of amnesty, while crimes falling in the category of serious human rights violations cannot be the subject of amnesty"
Serious human rights violations under international law which are listed as human rights violations in the amendment bill would therefore be subjects of amnesty
The special rapporteurs wrote that Section 155 of the bill establishes that the Commission shall make a recommendation for amnesty on the basis of the victims free consent and also considering the harm suffered by the victim as well as the statement made by the perpetrator to the Commission
"However, the bill does not clarify what happens when victims do not give consent for amnesty or when perpetrators fail to fulfil the aforementioned conditions for granting of amnesty, as there are no legal provisions to prosecute human rights violations which were not amnestied"
"This gap in the legislation, the special rapporteurs added, could lead to the nonprosecution of such cases, and therefore to de facto amnesties"
The bill does not foresee a recourse for victims to appeal against an amnesty recommendation or decision by the TRCThe bill states that sentencing will be as per existing law
"However, the bill fails to clarify which existing law would be used to prosecute those involved in serious human rights violations in a context where the penal code that came into force in 2018 prevents retroactive applicability of its provisions and includes time limitations for reporting crimes of rape, torture and enforced disappearances"
"For the crime of rape, time limitation is established at two years for an adult and three years for a minor"
"Stating that the transitional mechanisms had received 60,000 complaints, special rapporteurs said that the twoyear time to be given to this mechanism to complete the high volume of work wouldnt be enough"
The special rapporteurs expressed further concern that the bill does not include crimes against humanity under the jurisdiction of the TRC or the Special Court and that many violations listed in the bill as human rights violations may indeed amount to crimes against humanity
This could therefore lead to a grave impunity gap for the most serious crimes committed during the conflict

There are allegations of misuse of the governments COVID relief fund in Rautahats Durga Bhagawati Rural Municipality
Locals have accused local representatives and staff of depositing the relief meant for COVIDaffected poor households in Matsari of Ward No 3 of Durga Bhagawati in the accounts of dead persons and noncitizens by sidestepping the standard criteria
"The standard criteria of the government disqualifies families whose members are employed in any private, government or any organisations at home or abroad or are already receiving government allowances in any form, to get the relief"
"But, apparently, these criteria have been flouted to oblige people other than those eligible"
"Faudi Sah, who lost his wife to COVID19 and has been living a hard life ever since, has rued how he kept waiting for relief while those who werent as affected and fared better during the COVID period managed to pocket the relief much to the dismay of genuine victims"
What sort of justice is this he asked
Local Krishnamani Badshah expressed surprise at how those who spent long time in quarantine and whose family members died of COVID were excluded from the government relief

The Upendra Yadavled Janata Samajwadi PartyNepal termed the fivepoint deal that the home ministry reached yesterday with Gaur Massacre Victims Struggle Committee pledging to probe the people indicted in the first information reports in 2007 as a political stunt
"Earlier, during the protests in Rautahat, the Gaur Massacre Victims Struggle Committee had also demanded that a probe be conducted against JSPN Chair Yadav"
"On 21 March 2007, as many as 27 individuals associated with the then CPNMaoist were brutally killed after clashes erupted between the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum the mother party of JSPN and CPNMaoist Centre then known as CPNMaoist cadres over a mass meeting venue in Gaur"
JSPN Spokesperson Manish Kumar Suman said that the five pointdeal was nothing but a ploy to mislead the victims
"He said Gaur massacre was probed by six to seven probe committeescommissions, including the committee led by then Justice of the Supreme Court Khilraj Regmi, UNMIN, and the National Human Rights Commission"
"Some probe reports were made public but some were not, he added"
Suman said seven FIRs were filed in the aftermath of the Gaur massacre and 350 people were named on flimsy grounds
"Suman said if those FIRs were investigated, the probe would lead to nothing"
He said local people who were angry with JSPN leaders and cadres named them in the FIR to exact political revenge
Suman also said most of the probe committees that investigated the incident held the CPNMaoist responsible for the massacre
"Suman said the MJF had taken permission to hold a mass meeting at the programme venue two weeks prior to the programme, but CPNMaoist led by Prabhu Sah also organised a mass meeting at the same programme venue"
"Suman said if anybody wanted to investigate Gaur massacre after 17 years, then the best thing would be to form an allparty parliamentary committee"
"As far as I know, it was a political movement and all the people were on the street when the incident occurred"
"It was an accident rather than a criminal incident and if it has to be probed, then it should be probed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Suman said and added that nobody was interested in entrusting the TRC with the responsibility to probe the Gaur massacre"
"Suman said his party had taken note of the fivepoint deal, but the party would continue to remain a partner in the current ruling coalition"

"Citing data received from Nepal Police, the National Human Rights Commission said there is nexus between foreign employment and migrant smuggling and trafficking"
"Although Nepal Police data do not allow one to examine the purpose of trafficking such as sexual exploitation, labour exploitation, organ trafficking and other,s and it also does not specify the destination  country of trafficking, majority of crossborder trafficking cases can be said to have occurred due to deception of the victims with promise of good employment"
"Data shows that in the fiscal 2019 20, a total of 136 trafficking cases were been filed with Nepal Police while this number was only 14 in the fiscal 202021, said a report on the Situation of Migrant Workers recently released by the rights body, Given the past trends of the trafficking cases filed with Nepal Police, the number of trafficking cases registered in the fiscal 202021 was unusually low and if data are true, one can reasonably attribute the low number of cases to the COVID19 pandemic and lockdown in the country"
"Overall, there were 478 trafficking victims recorded in fiscal years of 201920 and 202021"
"Among the victims, crossborder trafficking victims comprise 46 percent while the 54 percent were internal trafficking victims"
Both male and female were victims of trafficking though nearly 96 per cent were females against only 4 per cent males
"Similarly, child trafficking is also considerable given the fact that nearly four in 10 trafficking victims recorded with Nepal Police were children under 18 years"
"According to the report, Nepal Police data also suggest the emerging nature of trafficking and human smuggling in the context of foreign employment"
There have been lot of changes in the mode of trafficking in persons TIP and human smuggling
"A few years ago, the destination for TIP was mainly to India and it wass mainly for the purpose of prostitution, while the nature of TIP has changed nowadays"
"Now not only women but also men are victims and they are tafficked not only to India, but also across several countries in the world"
It is not only for the purpose of prostitution but also for labour exploitation
"On the basis of the smuggling cases dealt with by Human Trafficking and Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police in the fiscals 201920 and 202021, human smugglers use different routes to smuggle migrants to various countries"
At least 13 countries have been reported as destination countries for smuggling
The dichotomy between so called developed and developing countries or rich or poor countries almost vanishes in the face of migrant smuggling from Nepal
"Migrant smuggling destination countries include not only Europe, North America and Australia, but also the MiddleEast, Asia and African countries"
Main routes to reach the destination countries are not the direct
Smugglers use different indirect routes
"For example, in one case, it was found that at least 12 countries were used by the smuggler to transport a migrant to the US, and 11 countries in the case of transporting to Canada"
It is reported that migrant smuggling is very risky travel as well as costly for migrants
"Migrants are made captive on the route, and they are looted by hooligans and they also risk dying while being transported, It is also costly because some of the migrants smuggled to US who were interrogated by Police in Nepal reported that they spent more than Rs 5"

"There should be commitment from the government to ensure the protection and promotion of private investment by amending the bills that adversely affect the purpose and contribution of private schools, the statement said"

"On August 4, Janamat Party Vicepresident Abdul Khan, along with Minister of Labour and Transport of Madhes Province Chandan Singh submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Dahal to declare the TaraiMadhes a droughthit region and provide relief to the sufferers"
"However, experts say such a step should not be taken without thorough investigation of the water crisis"
Tarai is the water mine of the country
"The water crisis could be the result of lack of awareness and due to technical or construction failure, said hydrogeologist, Pratap Singh Tater, adding, This is just a way of garnering some funds for the parties"
"If the Tarai region dries up, the country will be unliveable"
Nepal has abundant water
Even 10 per cent has not been used yet
It is true that some places in Madhes are grappling with water crisis
"However, the water level has not decreased though consumption has increased drastically"
"Specific places are facing water shortage, said Rohit Gautam, director at well drillings and consulting engineers"
"Minister Chandan Singh said, We have sought relief funds for farmers and people in droughthit areas"
The traditional well and shallow wells have dried
Sizeable cultivable land has been left barren due to water shortage and minimum rainfall this year
"Hence, immediate relief and exemption of tariff on electricity used for irrigation should be provided to the farmers who have had to suffer"
"There is poor coordination among the central, provincial and local governments"
We need to come together and work to tackle the water crisis
This was one of the main agenda of Janamat Party

"Immediate action is required to fulfil the basic needs of the people, said Raju Shrestha, SNV, WASH Adviser"
"Tater also argued, Investigation of the issue is pertinent"
This is an alarming situation numerous people are facing
The government must send people to investigate what has happened
Action must be taken
"However, water scarcity is scarce in Tarai, not all parts are facing similar issues"
Locals lack awareness about the technology used for water
Few of the local levels have implemented directives to not install boring
They think that it affects their tube wells
Which is completely wrong
"Therefore, awareness of the use of technology should be enhanced, according to experts"
"Furthermore, it is necessary to clean the tubes and monitor the technical parts of the equipment"
"Sometimes, it can be a blockage in the pipes or construction failure"
The lifetime must have expired
"Hence, we need not be worried about the entire TaraiMadhes"
Only a few places are experiencing water crisis as consumption has dramatically increased which needs to be addressed immediately

"Though the Department of Revenue Investigation has already launched an inquiry focusing on customs evasion and revenue leakage committed by the racketeers during the passage of 100kg gold through Tribhuvan International Airport on July 19, the need for further investigation from the angle of organised crime was realised lately on the basis of suggestions and feedback received from various political parties and security experts"
"Attorney General Pokharel, who participated in the meeting with the prime minister, said PM Dahal was in favour of an investigation through the CIB due to the involvement of transnational smuggling racket in the 100kg gold smuggling case after being briefed about the various legal aspects of the investigation"
"Since revenue leakage was noticed after the recovery of the smuggled gold, the Department of Revenue Investigation is now conducting a thorough investigation"
"But the investigation showed that the scam involved organised crime, said AG Pokharel, adding, Therefore, according to the legal system, it was concluded that the CIB should proceed with further investigation from the angle of organised crime"
It is doubtful whether gold has been used as a mode of payment for anything
"Since there is the speculation of hundi and other illegal activities, there will be a comprehensive investigation into them, said CIB Chief Kiran Bajracharya"
The investigation into the crime of revenue evasion will continue through the Department of Revenue Investigation while the CIB will carry out major investigation into organised crime in the gold smuggling racket

"The Supreme Court has stayed the Election Commissions decision to impose fine of Rs 15,000 on Binod Mani Bhattarai for allegedly failing to make his election expenditure details public"
"A single bench of Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha stayed the EC decision to impose fine on Bhattarai apart from issuing a show cause notice to the ECBhattarai had contested parliamentary elections from Morang Constituency 2 on Hamro Nepali Party ticket, but lost the election"
The court observed that it was issuing an interim order keeping in mind the balance of convenience
"Bhattarai had submitted his election expenditure details to Provincial Election Office, Biratnagar, on December 18 in accordance with Section 72 4 of the House of Representatives Election Act, 2017"
The EC had slapped fine on candidates failing to make their election expenditure details public within the stipulated time in accordance with Section 31 2 of the Election Offence and Punishment Act
"Constitutional expert Bhimarjun Acharya who pleaded on behalf of Bhattarai told THT that although the SC order was in response to the writ petition his client filed, it would serve as a guidance for any other candidate who was aggrieved by the EC decision and sought legal remedy"
"He said Bhattarai had complied with the election laws and he had also made his election expenditure details public, yet the EC fined him without any basis"
"Acharya said that while the provisions requiring candidates to submit their election expenditure details and make them public within the stipulated time was aimed at ensuring transparency on the part of the candidate and promoting fiscal discipline and discouraging candidates from running expensive election campaign, the EC lacked merit to punish those candidates that had already submitted their election expenditure details to the provincial election office"
Candidates cannot be expected to submit their details to the EC in Kathmandu
"It is okay if candidates submit their details in any level of the EC office, Acharya argued"
He said imposing fine on his client showed lack of coordination between the EC and its subordinate agencies
"On July 25, the Election Commission had imposed fine on 2,435 candidates  1,037 parliamentary candidates and 1,398 provincial candidates  for failing to make their election expenditure details public"
